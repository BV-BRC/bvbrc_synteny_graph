# Synteny Graph

## Overview

Whole-genome alignment and pan-genome analysis are useful tools in understanding the similarities and differences of many genomes in an evolutionary context. Here we introduce the concept of pan-synteny graphs, an analysis method that combines elements of both to represent conservation and change of multiple prokaryotic genomes at an architectural level. Pan-synteny graphs represent a reference free approach for the comparison of many genomes and allows for the identification of synteny, insertion, deletion, replacement, inversion, recombination, missed assembly joins, evolutionary hotspots, and reference based scaffolding.

## About this module

This module is a component of the BV-BRC build system. It is designed to fit into the
`dev_container` infrastructure which manages development and production deployment of
the components of the BV-BRC. More documentation is available [here](https://github.com/BV-BRC/dev_container/tree/master/README.md).
